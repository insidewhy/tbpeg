# TBPEGs

TBPEGs are an extension to PEGs where the grammar and AST structure can be described in a single language.

TBPEG Implementations are provided elsewhere in [JavaScript](https://github.com/nuisanceofcats/trek.js), [C++](https://github.com/nuisanceofcats/chilon) and [D](https://github.com/nuisanceofcats/teg).

The paper can be downloaded as a [pdf](https://github.com/nuisanceofcats/tbpeg/raw/master/tbpeg.pdf).
